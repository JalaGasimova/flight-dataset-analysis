# flight-dataset-analysis
Flight data exploration and visualization using Python
This project explores and analyzes a flight dataset to gain insights into flight patterns,pricing trends, and other key metrics. The goal is to perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to better understand factors affecting flight data.

Project Overview

üîπ Key Steps in the Project

1. Data Cleaning

Checked and corrected data types

Removed duplicates

Handled missing values

Detected and reviewed outliers

Standardized categorical values



2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Summary statistics of numerical and categorical features

Unique values analysis to identify anomalies

Distribution checks with histograms and boxplots

Normality tests for numerical variables



3. Visualization

Histograms, boxplots, and scatterplots to detect patterns

Outlier visualization for Price and Duration

Trends and relationships among Price, Duration, and Stops
